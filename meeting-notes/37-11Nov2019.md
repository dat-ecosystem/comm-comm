- mauve mentions something that substack has been working on for reducing the amount of indexing work
- noffle mentions similarities with how hyperdrive works.
- question from eric
    - traditional databases created B-trees for indexes, so can indexes be distributed across peers for each branch of the tree?â€©

### How can we empower activists?

- some interesting topics:
    - secure communication
    - secure browsing
    - explain the benefits of decentralized topological networks
    - Have more discussions (and general info) about these technologies
    - example from catalunya, they have a decentralized app (*tsunami democratic*) which they are using successfully -> https://tsunamidemocratic.github.io/
