## Meeting

### dat-sdk questions
- Nina has been building something using [dat-sdk](https://github.com/datproject/sdk) and hypertrie. Trying to use dat-sdk with hypertrie.
  - demo code to check the correct setup: https://github.com/ninabreznik/trie-seeder/blob/master/demo/demo.jsâ€©
  - rangermauve suggest using hypertrie with corestore
  - Their use case consists of dealing with thousands of contracts.
- data retrieval, Martin suggest the use of hyperdrivev10 instead of the raw hypertrie api.
- mauve roadmap for dat-sdk, he would like to finish/complete with hyperdrive/core support for the end of October.

### dat2.0
- Sam asks about timelines for the new version of dat. hypercore protocols (v7) changes are coming and they will be probably the last breaking changes for a while.
- question from the chat: does the noise stuff open up dat for transports over overlay networks e.g. cjdns or something? short answer: no. That would be handled by the peer discovery layer
- dat2 = hyperdrive v10 + hypercore with hypercore-protocol v7
- backwards compatibility
    - might have both hyperswarm and v10 running at the same time as discovery-swarm and v9
        - try to load v10 first, fallback to v9
    - Security considerations for protocol backwards compatibility. See TLS/SSL situation

### Dat Governance
- Reaching out other orgs (using Dat) to create something like w3c-like but for Dat. core team + orgs
- Question from the chat: will that governance extend into managing pull requests somehow?
  - It's open. Possibly.
- Good examples of an organization like this are welcome.
  - Add your links.
- For example, deciding about how/when to implement something like multiwritter support could involve/benefit from a governance team.
- Micah mentions that it would be interesting to check the [Blender Foundation](https://www.blender.org/foundation)
- Many in the Dat community are doing such a wonderful job of staying aware of what people are doing and being weavers and teachers.  People are also considerate of what others are doing when writing new modules.  How could new community members learn how to do the same?
- Also if a governance model is selected, from the community side it would be nice to institutionalize the good values that we currently have and make us different from other communities.

### Sam work with webext extensions
- high level abstraction to share data btw dat extensions. This could enable build webapps that rely more efficiently on the dat stack.

### Is megafeed going to be open sourced soon?
- Wireline is the company behind it. Lots of changes are going on these days at API-level. The answer is related to the API stability.

### New discovery-swarm-webrtc version
- Today, Martin from GEUT will publish a new version which includes the MST work from mauve and others improvements. See more here: https://github.com/geut/discovery-swarm-webrtc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

### CRDTs and Dat
- Martin recommends these days [yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs) if you want to play with crdts and Dat.

### wizardamigos
- Check out: https://twitter.com/wizardamigos If you are near Thailand in October. If you are near and want to join it would be an excellent oportunity to learn more and share some knowledge about dat and P2P. See more here: https://ninabreznik.typeform.com/to/Q8i4zN
