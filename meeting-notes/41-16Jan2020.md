# dat protocol Community Communication

16 Jan 2020

## People

* [Diego](https://github.com/dpaez)
* [Eric Rangell](https://github.com/erangell)
* [Eric Drechsel](https://eric.pdxhub.org)
* [Kevin Faaborg](https://github.com/zootella)
* [Micah (@micahscopes)](https://github.com/micahscopes)
* [Bret Comnes](https://bret.io)

## Topics

- From [@micahscopes comment](https://github.com/dat-land/comm-comm/issues/118#issuecomment-574343594):
    - strategies for knowing when to wait on new features and when to just use what's already there
    - strategies for choosing the right level of abstraction
    - in thinking about the future of multi writer applications, understanding the relationship between:
      - corestore/Dat SDK
      - kappa-core like architectures
      - Dat 2 mounts/queries
      - example: in approaching building a multiwriter application, how might I choose between using a corestore of hyperdrives vs. a cluster of Dats all mounted to the same subdirectory of a parent Dat?

## Meeting

### Intro
- people introduction

### Notes about DAT Mentoring:
- Keybase team can become a Train-the-Trainer group for people interested in teaching DAT.
- Current members: Mauve, Diego, Eric, and 1 person from the Digital Life Collective.  Email Eric at erangell@gmail.com if interested.
- Eric started by creating verbose tests for the DAT SDK to learn how it works.
- Noted importance of setting reasonable expectations regarding the learning curve.
- Would be helpful to define requirements for pull requests (ex: linting, standards to follow)
- There is a need for mentees to build a solid understanding of JavaScript promises, async/event driven programming, and network debugging skills.
- Resources for people new to DAT: https://github.com/geut/dat-workshop and https://docs.datproject.org/docs/intro


### Going through topics section

#### dat ecosystem is in flux. How one can be up to date?
> strategies for knowing when to wait on new features and when to just use what's already there

- build knowledge of what's happening, how things fit together
    - sometimes you'll have to just read source code and tests to understand what a library does
- build little prototypes to see if new stuff really meets needs
- Eg: Eric verbose tests to the DAT SDK to learn how it works https://github.com/erangell/sdk

- Something we can do as a community: **share more examples!** We can use the [dat SDK 1.0 release](https://github.com/datproject/sdk/issues/31) to do this.

- FUSE and mounts as a replacement and better solution for hyperdb

- relation between multiwritter, corestore, kappadb. Seems like there are lots of abstractions and some people is exploring with this topic (multiwriter). It will be ideal to see some examples or projects using this.

- Eric Rangell shares: A lot of work is being done on https://github.com/inkandswitch/pushpin to upgrade it.  It was using auto merge for multiuser collaboration.

- Eric also shares a mentoring session with Mauve: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vGbJ68yxN0
