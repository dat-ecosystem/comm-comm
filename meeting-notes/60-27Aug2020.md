## Meeting Notes

### Intro
- doug, from Canada, working with p2p stuff dat and ipfs. Trying to get dat dns working. Interested in crypto and self sovereignty. See if we can use dat/hyper to doing that.
- telamohn, freelance hacker. Working on p2p stuff too. Based in Sweden.
- clement, student based in France.
- martin acosta, from Argentina. Work at GEUT with dat/hyper.
- martin h, working with mobile apps and dat these days.
- james, first time here. From Scotland. Current project: A network library Peer-to-Peer https://youtu.be/RLdCjaliOCo  talk from Dat Conf 2020  https://github.com/DaMaHub/networklibrary/tree/master/xlibrary  and I use this in https://github.com/healthscience/diyhstoolkit
- mardab [couldn't hear much sorry, feel free to add your intro here :)]
- kevin, working on ara.one. Been doing p2p from a while.
- mauve: doing lot of dat and hyper stuff. Lately working with a new module, multi hyperdrive which allows multi writter support. co-hyperdrive, a new top level module based on the former. Plans to use this on natakanau project. Collaborate offline easily. Also working on agregore, the p2p browser. Working on improving extensions these days. Working on dat-fetch, a http like interface. plans to integrate more with gateway browser. 1-1 feature.
- jwerle, having been writing much hyper recently, but  involved with the community. Using dat for many projects, one is a tool that helps to share units of info btw communities/schools. Using hypercores and hyperswarm in the background. Lots of learning. Also doing something similar for the goverment/mechanics on conditions where internet was not reliable/disable. You can see more here: https://github.com/little-core-labs 

### `hyperdex` by telamon

- offline search engine :cool:
- distributed not decentralized (when >1 indexers = decentralized ;))  :)
- there is a robot, [`hyperspace-indexer`.](https://github.com/telamon/hyperspace-indexer)
    - crawling around
    - anything that the robot discover, is transmitted into an hyperdrive
- the other component is [`hyperdex`](https://github.com/telamon/hyperdex)


### Hyperdomain and Dat DNS status

- Context: differences/similarities btw ethereum dns approach and dat dns. Transaction time is high on ethereum. Also saw some conversation on a beaker thread.

- Q: what's the status of hyperdomain?
- Q: Dat DNS (TXT record and /.well-known still valid?)
- Q: dat:// vs hyper:// switch-over progress (are both valid or just hyper?)
    - dat is deprecated
    - dat:// is legacy
    - different structure comes with hyper
- Q: If I update a mounted hyperdrive while the main drive is offline, will the mount replicate the updates to other peers (I haven't tried this out yet, wondering if it works in theory)
    - if someone else is replicating, then they can replicate the mounted.

- James added: these project out with dat might be of interest https://handshake.org, https://namebase.io 
- martin h, the more I think about the dat dns future the more I like the old approach. Seems like its an intrincally centralized problem.

### datrs
- Q: what's the current status of datrs?
- datrs video from dat conference: https://twitter.com/liminalpunk/status/1290306872977678336

### P2P middleware

- james, there are some patterns, there is a lot of repetition even btw decentralized projects (when you are building a new p2p project).
- looking/reflecting at the whole industry.
- there are different stacks for doing web development
- doing decentralized web development is not that different. It would be nice to have some clear stack.
- mauve: you can checkout [dat-sdk](https://github.com/datproject/sdk).
- also you can contribute to [dat-fetch](https://github.com/RangerMauve/dat-fetch) :heavy_exclamation_mark:
