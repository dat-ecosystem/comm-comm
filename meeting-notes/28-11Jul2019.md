## People

- [Martin Heidegger](https://github.com/martinheidegger) [[Consento](https://consento.org)]

## Topics

### Introduction

Nina and Alexander work together as a team in London

Martin arrived back for a bit in Osaka after the [Ledger event](https://github.com/consento-org/events/issues/1).
Presenting [https://consento.org] - the new project he is working on with [Georepublic](https://georepublic.de)
and [Port Parallele](https://portparallele.com/).

### NGI Ledger

The [LEDGER program](https://www.ngi.eu/opencalls/ledger/) is a funding project by the EU for OSS software,
besides [consetwo other projects with links to DAT also got funding:

- [Heimdall](https://heimdall.cloud/)
- [Cobox](https://cobox.cloud/)

The documentation for Ledger is work but within reason. If you have a good idea: certainly apply!

### Ethereum event in Osaka

Nina and Alexander are working currently for the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/) and will
join the Ethereum event in Osaka, beginning of october! https://devcon.org.

For the occasion Martin will meet them. We will also plan an adjecent event in the [georepublic office](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/6389783433).

Martin has the theory that part of the choice for Osaka is https://iohk.io/

### Ethereum VS Dat

Martin mentions that the biggest thing between Ethereum and Dat is the lack of a consensus in Dat. Though this 
comes with the advantage of removing sources of latency and cost when working with Dat.

Nina mentions that Ethereum beside the proof-of-work also works on proof-of-stake and other mechanisms
to come to consensus.

### "Team Play"

The project of Alex and Nina at Ethereum is [team Play](https://ethereum-play.github.io/editor-solidity/)
which keeps smart contracts stored in DAT. Team Play as a project now have to graduate.

We talked about ways to get funding for OSS & p2p projects.

- Grants (like NGI)
- business model

We talked about how "good p2p business models are hard" because capitalism supports monopolies
and central structures.

An older business idea from martin revolved around creating a Dat based system to get data in/out
of a super computing system. [darp2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/darp2) as a prototype allows to
selectively take ad process data which could be a business idea for someone in the Dat space to adopt.

Consento tries to go empower smaller busineses creating an open market around this p2p solution rather
than controlling it.

We came to talk about how certification can be a business model and came to the https example:

### Certification

1. Every computer has a list of "root certificates" this is issued by the IANA.
2. Each certificate is owned-by/associated-with an organization (company). ex. digicert
3. Each company needs to comply to IANA standards
4. Corrupting one instance means corrupting all instances

Some highlights:

1. If the root system can not be trusted, nothing can be trusted
2. How can IANA be trusted? Through processes that they adhere to
3. Each authority stakes their business on being trustworthy (like a lawyer)
4. Part of the IANA standard for the certification authorities likely entails adherence to
    security best practices (ISO)
5. The verification of the organizations in itself is not for free.

Then we talked about ways to apply a similar model to "Team Play".

### Opensource Financing Ethereum

In the conversation we also had a "quick brainstorm" on how to "solve"
opensource financing using a decentralized solution based on ethereum contracts:

_Initial question:_ How can we argue the amount of funding for a project?
_Answer:_

  - OSS team has "core supporter" that okay's a monthly budget.
  - The core supporter "okays" it by putting the specified amount of money into a ethereum contract.
  - The contract allows for additional supporters to join the "monthly pot".
  - With every contributor the share of all the other contributors is reduced and returned.

The more contributors, the less burden on the core supporter - incentive for the core supporter to find more supporters!

Contract:

  - Starts with specified budget.
  - first user (core supporter) gives full amount in escrow! (he gives the okay to the budget)
  - second user joining needs to give half of the amount in escrow! (if only two users are in the bucket end of month: 1st user will get 1/2 back)
  - third user gives 1/3 amount in escrow! (first user will get: 2/3 back, second user: 1/6)
  - ...
  - end of month, the owner of the buckets gets the content of budget â†’ restart
