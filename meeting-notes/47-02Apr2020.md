## Meeting Notes

### intro

Questions always as soon as they arise!

This is a "Community Call". You can just start one by adding yours into the repository (comm-comm repo). Could be event and announcements.

Recent announcement:
- [DAT SSG](https://github.com/datproject/comm-comm/issues/130)
- [Proposal, standard related feed](https://github.com/datproject/comm-comm/issues/134)

Status update for Beaker! :tada: (oh sorry, just fully listened X)

Eric is from pensylvania.

[Microsoft BLAZOR](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) - WebAssembly version coming out. Question how DAT could be added, and if so if easier.
Blazor Web Assembly Preview: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/blazor-webassembly-3-2-0-preview-3-release-now-available/

Per: Update, update, update.

[Mozilla Grant](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/03/30/were-fixing-the-internet-join-us/) in 4 days! 1-4 ppl.

## Dat on react-native

Cool stuff, sorry missed typing down.

Dat Foundation meeting took place. @leichtgewicht participated

Next version of beaker in private beta. Things are progessing nicely.

Rough plan for a online conference in summer. Hopefully with a public beta of Beaker coming out.

Community members already applied for the closed beta. We encourage just sending another cheerio!-email.

New Beaker will feature new Hyperswarm/Hyperdrive.
Backwards compatibilty will maybe break (more or less API compatible). Fear of fragmentation in existing code base.
Hyperdrive breaking update could be rupturus.

Hashbase.io -> Currently in update. Help wanted! Worries are that hashbase will be left behind.
Hashbase is MIT based and could be forked for carrying it forward. But PRs are always happily reviewed and eventually accepted.

Members missing, currently moving countries -- COVID related.

Devs trying to add internal interfaces/indirection in order to be Dat version independent. Thoughts about using these ideas for updating hashbase. (Ref. some link)

Dev calling for more documentation. But generally devs are happy ;D

Martin w/ Consento is using Typescrypt. Pushing to use TS with Dat. Some technical problems though. `d.ts` files could be added in Dat repos. Check @mafintosh or @yoshuawyuts recent repos.

Martin will look into this!

Server model -> Computation on the server -> Computed results are sendt to clients.
Next release will allow: "Full web assembly". First load 2MB. But then everything runs natively. That way access to device features is available. Dat could be a transport to sync data.
C# will be enabled to write code! :tada: Code will be transcoded into WebAssembly.

**As Electron replacement:**
Code => compinling -> DLL -> Plug into .Net. 
Clients receives the framework, then the dll of the applicaiton.
Application should be able to utilize DAT protocoll. Is there a way to simply call it? Devs could be enabled to use Dat simply.

From disuccion on previous point:
What about Beaker? WebAssembly support? Dat itself uses Libsodium, no WebAssembly compatible implementation there. There is one though -- problem somewhere.


ReactNative archetecture discussion. Frameworks differ in APIs -> sys calls are handled differently.

.NET standard available. Blazer (name?/link? :D) will support that.

TypeScript should help to make internal state visible in the Dat stack. Since individual components are stacked (hyper, hyper! it's cool that way!) devs would like to "see through" and see all available config options that are passed on through to wrapped parts.

-> There is a tasklist.

ReactNative sodium is async (promise based). Passed on buffers are serialized (can be computation heavy).
Dat need sync crypto lib. So development needed.

ChakraCore may not yet run sodium-mobile or -native.

react-native dev talk. Hyperdivision is beeing called for.

Will the next hypercore version be able to be run in the web browser?

expo.io
-> may add info?

Ideas about native crypto implementation: Could not Andoid/iOS crypto be replaced by Web SubtleCrypto API.
Just ping @martinheidegger Discussion ongoing.
Problems could arise when crypto is handled outside JS.
There are optimization arguments (w/ regards to high fidelity video/audio live encryption).

Sam did some prior work on the above sync/async problem.

Live blog post publishing while on COMMCOMM https://consento.org/blog/mobile-first/

@RangerMauve is on the RPC bridge. (Freenode, #Dat)

Sam wants to run Dat inside a service worker to separate it out. But how to do networking now? Messaging bridge? ("peer data")
How is that case handled?
Use case would be a CDN service.

Discussion about how services and how Beaker renders.
