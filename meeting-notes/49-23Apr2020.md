## Meeting Notes

### Intro

- mauve: working with datdot and ... .Release a couple of projects recently (https://github.com/RangerMauve/p2plex/). Multiplex peers streams. real-time communicaton apps, and different things going over a single connection. More easily to dedup connections. Similar idea to libp2p: combine the hyperswarm for peer discovery and noise for encryption / authentication and multiplex for sending multiple streams of data at once. Made for the datdot project. [dat gossip](https://github.com/RangerMauve/dat-gossip) like a PoC of gossiping keys, eg chat app sharing hypercores, you can use this gossip module for share these hypercore keys and easily discover data.
- Kevin: Continue working with Ara, and electron apps. Looking for static site generators, getting familiar with vue, react and next.js. Goal, improve the static site generation with beaker. Bring a jamstack to dat?
- peg: has been working with cobox. Currently working on other things (java implementation of crystal, similar to consento), also a JS implementation of that. Sideline project (hobby): distributed index for media files. Like a file sharing app using kappa-core to distribute the index of files along with some metadata.

## Event update

CFP coming soon, some dates are fixed.

We will probably end up using Big Blue Button since it gives a lot of flexibility.
We also want to explore more the idea around Mozilla Hubs, not only for presentations but also as a place for general conversation (side talks, chit chat)

### conflict resolution (cobox)

peg: read about bloom filtering to do this but decided to go with vector clocks instead of bloom clocks. A bit hard to test. kind of depend how people uses it. They are not  using actively working tasks. Different approach.
mauve: where do you store vector clocks?
peg: using a different feed (vector feed). frando proposes using more the metadata feed.
mauve: one vector clock or more like a profile thing?
peg: profile (multiple vectors?)
mauve: was looking around for different approaches.

peg: https://gitlab.com/coboxcoop/kappa-drive/-/blob/master/index.js#L502
https://gitlab.com/coboxcoop/kappa-drive/-/blob/master/index.js#L383

mauve: why store it in kappa instead of metadata?
peg: it is in the feed and the feed is aggregated using kappa core.
mauve: is the tradeoff storing a bit of stuff in leveldb for improved reads?
peg: it was the way we see it.

### static site gens

kevin: every website starts with an index.html and that's it. You can upload and even edited from the browser. That's the feeling that I'm looking for.
This can work on beaker and everywhere actually, like [zeronet](https://zeronet.io/)
Also the indie web community has an interest on this too. They are using _microformats_ (something like an RSS)
mauve: that tech is still using servers (diff).
kevin: projects related to the day work, related to ARA.
mauve: did something similar in the past https://github.com/RangerMauve/dat-site-gen
kevin: E.g.; ghost site generator. It changed into a headless CMS and loose the blog feature which was the most interesting one.
