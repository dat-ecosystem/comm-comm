## Intros

- Joe: Working on Ara, used hypercore a bunch
- Doug: Working on a persistent IPNS alternative for IPFS using multifeed (I call it HyPNS, lol)
- Kyran: Working on Agregore with Mauve
- Gene: Working on multi-hyperbee and thinking about personal cloud storage for p2p data
- Kevin: Working on Ara with Joe


## Notes

- Curious when #45 (https://github.com/kappa-db/multifeed/pull/45) will be merged into multifeed?

## Hyperbee

- Doug: Asking about why hyperbee
- Gene: Needed range queries, was compatible with levelup which could be used to layer a bunch of other things. Layering dynamodb, gives us secondary indexes and complex queries which cannot do by itself in hypertrie. Ran tests for dynamo DB and they all pass for hyperbee, seems quite mature

## HyPNS (Hypercore + IPNS)

https://github.com/DougAnderson444/HyPNS

The idea was to use multifeed to enable people save their IPFS merkle root somewhere persistent

Gene: What was the issue with IPNS? COuld we get help comparing IPFS with hypercore?

Doug: Recently did a high level comparison, will add to notes later

https://github.com/RangerMauve/p2p-fetch
^^^ Use a browser polyfill to fecth ipfs or hyper in the browser

Kyran: What's load time like for p2p fetch?

Mauve: On load would be bad, lazy loading would be fine
