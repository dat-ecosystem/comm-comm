## Meeting Notes

- _Talking about hyperdrive/hypertrie before the meeting starts_
  - serapath is looking into using [hypertrie](https://github.com/mafintosh/hypertrie) for storing data. Hyperdrive is hard to use when you have many files in a directory
  - rangermauve mentions that this is a problem with all filesystems
  - serapath asks about whether it'd be possible to take data from a hypertrie and write it back to the filesystem
  - rangermauve mentions that it'd be hard and that's one of the reasons hyperdrive would be useful
- _people introuduction_
- Don Blair is working with some tech projects with farmers. Also doing some cool stuff with cabal and sensors.
    - Some thoughts/links/ideas he gathers on the topic of p2p, solarpunk etc. https://mosspig.org/
    - He has a question about how to use discovery modules in _mesh-like_ networks (similar to?. How can one setup your own custom bootstrap server (local network)?
    - rangermauve mentions that dat uses mdns (multicast dns) to solve discovery on local networks. Maybe don blair network does not support mdns.
    - It'd be nice to improve the dx working with mdns.
- Don also asks about the recommended go-to hardware for building a dat network for farmers (outdoors?)?
    - rangermauve mentions [libre router](https://librerouter.org/). A project for building community mesh networks. A ssb community in Brazil is using this hw setup.
- Discussion about mesh networks and Dat.
    - Mesh networks using decentralized apps!
    - mdns on a mesh network
    - creative people creating content for the decentralized world

She worked on apps for refugees in Berlin, connecting locals business with refugees (job oportunities). These days she is working with Dat and looking for more oportunities around the Dat space.
